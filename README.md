# PingCRM - React + FastAPI

A modern remake of the PingCRM project using **React** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend.

This app supports full **Contact Management** and **Company Management**, integrated with **Supabase PostgreSQL** as the database. It features a clean dashboard UI, searching, filtering, and CRUD functionality.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

### üì¶ Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
1. cd backend
2. Install Python (if not already installed)
3. Create virtual environment:
   - macOS/Linux: python3 -m venv .venv
   - Windows: python -m venv .venv
4. Activate virtual environment:
   - macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
   - Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
5. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Create a `.env` file from the example:
   mv .env.example .env
   # Then set your DATABASE_URL to your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string
7. Run the FastAPI server:
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## üíª Frontend (React)

```bash
1. cd frontend
2. Create a `.env` file from the example:
   mv .env.example .env
3. Update the environment variable:
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://pingcrm-obbi.onrender.com
   # Or replace with your own backend deployment URL
4. Install frontend dependencies:
   npm install
5. Start the development server:
   npm start
```

## üß† Database Details

This project uses **Supabase PostgreSQL** as the backend database.

- Connected to the backend via **SQLAlchemy**
- Used `create_engine()` with the Supabase connection string
- Connection string stored securely in the `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL`
- Tables:
  - `contacts`: Stores name, phone, city, and associated company
  - `companies`: Stores names, phone, city, email, address, province, country and postal_code
